# ICG_analysis

Small project to track ICG fluorescence of surgical videos using object tracking in OpenCV. Can track over the whole frame or draw a bounding box around an object of interest (eye, for example) to account for movement of the patient during surgery. Fits a curve to the tracked fluorescence to understand the time stamp at which fluorescence occurs. Long term goal of this analysis to understand where there may be malignant lesions in the eye leading to fluorescence sooner in the video. Also records the area of fluorescence using thresholding operation.
